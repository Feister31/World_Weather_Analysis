# World_Weather_Analysis
### The purpose of this challenge was to create a travel plan for a European trip based on the temperature and humidity. As well as finding rural hotels between all of the destinations. While connecting to the google maps API. I was able to locate the precise location of each town marked and find the easiest route to get from each destination. This can be applied to traveling to familiar areas where getting directions verbally might be difficult. <img width="938" alt="WeatherPy_itenerary" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92479644/152735437-5b6651ba-c2bb-4c2b-a7f1-b55c55e784f8.png">
